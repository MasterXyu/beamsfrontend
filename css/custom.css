A blank stylesheet for you to customize Beams to your heart's content! Whatever your particular project needs that we've left out, put it here. 

And, hey, if you think you've come up with something we should add or change in the public version of Beams, please send us a pull request on GitHub (https://github.com/peteramckay/beams) or email me anytime at peteramckay@gmail.com. 

Beams is an open project under MIT license, built with love and reliant on it, too. - Pete
