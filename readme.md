Beam
=========

Beam is a responsive framework created primarily with video sites in mind. It should also integrate well with other types of Web projects that require beautiful display across different types of devices. 

Key component of the project so far is a responsive layout written in CSS3 using a gutterless 40-column 4,000-pixel grid that sizes down elegantly to the size of a smartphone screen or anything inbetween. There were two main goals in creating the grid this way:

1) Natively cover an even wider array of devices than the typical responsive framework based on a 960-pixel grid or something similar.   

2) Rely on simple round-number breakpoints rather than media queries based on particular manufacturers' screen sizes. This should make the framework more future-proof in case of hardware changes, which seem to happen rapidly these days. 

Every column here is 100 pixels wide. That's it. 

I've also included a copy of the compressed jQuery v2.1.0 file in this project so Beam implementers can quickly access that popular library from their own servers. I may add other JavaScript enhancements later so that Beam becomes an even more of a full-fledged development tool.

Will certainly be adding integration with YouTube and Kaltura APIs for video players, etc, in short order. Of course, we're going to need that for the sake of video integration.
