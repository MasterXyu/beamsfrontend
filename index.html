      <p>Beams is a front-end Web framework designed primarily for multimedia-heavy sites. It is the centerpiece of a suite of open-source modules for developers who need to support video, photos, and other content across the widest range of screens and use cases possible.</p>
      <p>The Beams suite is currently at v0.1.0, an alpha release. The modules are still a bit rough around the edges, to be sure. But we believe we at least have a good start here, something we can show to other developers, begin to build a community around, and begin iterating quickly.</p>
      <p>A quick summary of the modules, including a link to each one's code repo on GitHub:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/peteramckay/beams" target="blank">Beams.</a></strong> The flagship of the suite, this is a front-end Web framework built in HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. The visual design is based on a responsive 20-column, 4,000-pixel grid -- approximately the screen size of a 48-inch TV. Yet the framework also scales down smoothly to any other size from desktop to tablet to smartphone as well.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="beamsserver/readme.md">Beams Server.</a></strong> A simple server written in Node.js/Espresso for running feature-rich sites created with the front-end module.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="beamsads/readme.md">Beams Ads.</a></strong> An optional jQuery plugin for showing interstitial display ads. You can also control how often a user sees an ad and track views of the ads with Google Analytics, all while maintaining responsive display across different screen sizes for your sponsors too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're glad to get pull requests, bug reports, or any other feedback you have about Beams. Drop us an <a href="mailto:peteramckay@gmail.com">email</a> anytime or hit us up on <a href="http://github.com/peteramckay/beams" target="blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h2>Another headline goes here</h2>
      <p>But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?</p>
      <blockquote><p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
      <p>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
